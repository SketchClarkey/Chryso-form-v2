# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for
receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Chryso Form v2 team and community take security bugs seriously. We
appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make
every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:
[security@yourcompany.com](mailto:security@yourcompany.com)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not,
please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include the following information along with your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting,
  etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is
confirmed and a fix is developed.

### Notification Process

1. Security vulnerabilities are privately reported
2. The security team acknowledges receipt within 48 hours
3. A fix is developed and tested
4. A security advisory is prepared
5. The fix is released with a security update
6. The security advisory is published

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
- **Validate all inputs**: Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- **Use parameterized queries**: Prevent SQL injection attacks
- **Implement proper authentication**: Use secure authentication mechanisms
- **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update dependencies to patch
  vulnerabilities
- **Follow secure coding practices**: Use static analysis tools and security
  linters

### For Users

- **Keep your installation updated**: Always use the latest version
- **Secure your environment**: Use HTTPS, secure your MongoDB instance
- **Use strong authentication**: Implement strong passwords and 2FA where
  possible
- **Monitor your logs**: Keep an eye on unusual activity
- **Regular backups**: Maintain regular backups of your data

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt for password security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing setup
- **Security Headers**: Implementation of security headers
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies

### Planned Security Enhancements

- Rate limiting implementation
- Advanced logging and monitoring
- OAuth 2.0 integration
- Two-factor authentication
- API key management
- Enhanced audit logging

## Vulnerability Management

### Assessment Process

1. **Triage**: Initial assessment of the reported vulnerability
2. **Investigation**: Detailed analysis and reproduction
3. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluation of potential impact
4. **Fix Development**: Development of appropriate fixes
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of the fix
6. **Release**: Coordinated release of the security update

### Severity Levels

We use the CVSS v3.0 scoring system to assess vulnerability severity:

- **Critical (9.0-10.0)**: Immediate action required
- **High (7.0-8.9)**: Fix within 7 days
- **Medium (4.0-6.9)**: Fix within 30 days
- **Low (0.1-3.9)**: Fix in next regular release

## Security Tools and Scanning

### Automated Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** with npm audit
- **Code quality analysis** with SonarQube
- **Static security analysis** with ESLint security rules
- **Container scanning** for Docker images

### Security Testing

- **Penetration testing** for critical releases
- **Security code reviews** for all changes
- **Dependency auditing** in development workflow
- **Security-focused end-to-end tests**

## Compliance and Standards

We strive to maintain compliance with industry standards:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Implementation of security best practices
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management principles
